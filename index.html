			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>The harm principle</b></td>
				<td>The law should only restrict individual freedom if it can be shown that the individual's behavior is causing harm to others</td>
				<td>The harm principle is not sufficient, and the law should be used ... to restrict individual freedom in order to protect society as a whole, even if no direct harm is being caused.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Criminal law</b></td>
      <td>Criminal law should only be used to prohibit actions that directly harm others or infringe on their rights</td>

      <td>Overlap Thesis: Devlin believed that the law should reflect the moral values of society. </td>
      </tr>
      <td><b>Summary</b></td>
      <td>Hart believed that the law should be used to regulate human behavior only insofar as it caused harm to others, and that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without excessive interference from the state. </td>
      <td> Devlin, on the other hand, believed that the law should be used to promote and enforce the most important moral values held by society, even if this requires some degree of interference in the lives of individuals.</td>
